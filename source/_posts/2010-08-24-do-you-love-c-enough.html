Hello world !!! <br /><br />When i step into the environment of blogging for the first time, i have only one thing in mind. I want to tell the world just a million times that i love C, and can't stop doing so.<br /><br />void love ();<br /><br />main ()<br />{<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; love();<br />}<br /><br />void love ()<br />{<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printf("\n I LOVE C SO MUCH !!!");<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; love();<br />} <br /><br />I thank Asha miss, my +2 teacher, for giving me a firm grip in the basics of C, for it seems i want to learn more of it, and others too.<br /><br />Are you feeling the vibe of this recursive passion?
