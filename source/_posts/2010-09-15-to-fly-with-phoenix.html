Well, I must say, simplicity and brilliance is what a FOSS meet will be <br />all about, if you watch the proper people. For the <b>National Conference </b><br /><b>on Free Software And Education, September 10-12, 2010,</b> me and<br />my four friends Prasanth, Remya, Sumith and Sunil geared up with a handy electronic instrument called the Phoenix(aptly named), and barged in<br />through the front gates. We came to know about the Phoenix from our<br />teacher, <b>Mr. Pramode C. E.</b>, and beacme interested. This interest made<br />us to take it to the FOSS meet and do a few tricks with it, with guidance<br />from Pramode Sir. Some mistakes and pitfalls happened too.<br /><br />First of all, whats '<b>Phoenix</b>'? Its an electronic gadget with an Atmel <br />ATmega16 mcu inside it, with hardware peripherals including a DAC, ADC,<br />digital I/O pins, comparator, waveform generator, amplifier, etc, <br />necessray to build a simple circuit. The point? The whole Phoenix board<br />is set up such that a large variety of experiments from Physics can be <br />conducted with ease. Highly accurate measurements are thus possible. <br />Experiments include a simple charging-discharging cycle of a capacitor,<br />to alpha particle radiation measurement from a radiative source. Plus, <br />the board runs in C, with the computer front-end being Python. Hows <br />that? An 'open hardware', it may be called, maybe the first of its kind.<br /><br />Coming back, the first day was at Tagore Centinery Hall, Calicut Town. <br />A banner highlighted by the face of <b>Richard Mathew Stallman a.k.a </b><br /><b>R. M. S.</b> greeted us. Volunteeers and coordinators from NIT Calicut, gave<br />a brief picture of the schedule. Understood that, only the inaugral <br />ceremony with a keynote address from R. M. S. will be arranged that day.<br />At the far end, some tables were set up, and many free software users <br />were vigorously working with their laptops. <br /><br />We were to see <b>Mr. Sasikumar</b>, the 'R. M. S.' of Kerala. Till then, we <br />were just standing their groping with our belongings, not knowing what <br />to do. Once we met him, the situation changed abruptly. We were greeted <br />with a warm, enthusiastic, polite smile, and ushered to the expo area. <br />The volunteers were asked to allot a table for us. Then, we became a <br />part of the event.<br /><br />Till the original R. M. S. arrived on the scene, the expo continued. A<br />few people came to visit the 'stalls'. There were students, enthusiasts,<br />Physics teachers, and others who came to see what Phoenix was. There <br />were Phoenix users among them too, who wanted to see if any newer <br />features have been developed for the Phoenix.<br /><br />Finally, I learned that R. M. S. had arrived, and has gone inside the <br />Hall, while my back was turned. Soon, everyone got inside, and I saw <br />the guy for the first time. I was seeing a cute-in-an-odd-kind-of-way,<br />big, living genius. I stared at him for long, with only one thought in<br />mind. I had to hear his voice too. Meanwhile the guest were asked to <br />get on stage. R. M. S. chose a side chair, but was ushered to the <br />center of the dias. Later, I saw him, kneeled down on his left leg, <br />drinking water from a bottle, kept on a table infrot of him. Well, <br />everything he did seemed cute and nice. A few moments later, he simply<br />yawned, and I couldnt help but smile.<br /><br />There were to be about 8 more felicitations before the keynote address<br />from R. M.  S. We couldnt wait that long, we had to get to our staying<br />places. We reached <b>NIT Calicut</b>, next day by noon. We  arrived before for<br />the lunch session and quickly set up the table. Many people came to us <br />during the break, to know about Phoenix. There was a Physics teacher, <br />who believed Physics has to be 'touched and learned'. But i had a <br />counter-point that Phoenix could do things otherwise impossible in a <br />lab. One particular student was so excited to hear about Phoenix, <br />because he had been looking around for such a low cost instrument for <br />obvious purposes. There was a table for IIT Bombay, who had come with <br />their project to create spoken-tutorials for all the major free <br />software applications available now. Shortly after the lunch session <br />was over, we packed our things and got out, because we had to reach <br />our shelters in the same day itself.<br /><br /><u>Mistakes</u>:<br />1. I didnt take photographs all through the event.<br />2. Didnt bring a banner or charts (showing the details of Phoenix) for<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; display purposes.<br />3. Didnt bring a better experiment apparatus, perhaps it could have <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gained more attention.<br /><br /><u>Pitfalls</u>:<br />1. We totally lost control of time. We were running for shelter to <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sleep, running to be present at the meet.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a nutshell, we couldnt sit for a single talk.<br /><br /><u>What we learned</u>:<br />1. What to expect and what not to in a FOSS meet.<br />2. The feeling when someone like Dr. Prabhu Ramachandran whizzes past <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you, and you continue to stare blankly, unable to utter a single word.<br />3. How it is to bring 'something' to the meet and to bring 'some real <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thing' to the meet, from the fact that, we had also brought along an <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; elementary study report on the <b>TinyPy Virtual Machine v1.1</b>.
